* first we create a store
* for creating a store we need two things, state and reducer
* after creating a reducer, with initialState
* we have to plugin  a store, and it has to be done in the hightest level (root level) ex:index.js
* and we have to import certain modules

* Provider from react-redux
* Provider will allow us to inject the global storage
* so we are going to wrap the entire app with the Provider
* and we need to create a store now,
* and we also need to import the reducer, and now we create the store and pass the reducer
* now we need to pass the store as the property
* now go the app, and comment the localState, because now we are going to use global state
